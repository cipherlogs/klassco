### Can I skip to class combos with greater lenghts?
Suppose you wish to directly ascend to level 7 (`--min 7`). It's important to
understand that abstracting 7 classes into a highly generalized form is not
feasible due to their complex nature.

If your abstraction is overly specific, its reusability diminishes, leading to
wasted time and effort. Instead, adopt a layered approach where each layer
depends on the one below it.

In practical scenarios, you typically won't exceed 5 to 8 layers. However,
these layers are portable and can be utilized across different projects or
shared with others.

This approach will significantly reduce the time previously spent on such
tasks, enhancing your efficiency.
