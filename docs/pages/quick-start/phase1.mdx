# Quick Start: Phase 1
In this phase of the [`Quick Start`](/quick-start) series, we'll explore a set
of features and core concepts to understand the utility of the tool. By the
end of the series, you should be able to make an informed decision about its
usefulness.

Before diving into complex examples, let's start with a simple component
designed with TailwindCSS. We'll use the `promo-sections` from
[tailwindui.com](#).

<Steps>
### Step 1
Copy the code of the first example component from
`https://tailwindui.com/components/ecommerce/components/promo-sections`.

### Step 2
Save the copied code in a file named `promo.jsx`.

### Step 3
Install Klassco and scan the component:

```bash
$ npm -g i klassco
$ klassco -m 1 promo.jsx
```

We're scanning for duplicates of length 1, which helps identify unnecessary
classes that might have been added by mistake.

The results might look something like this:

```bash
+ promo.jsx:
        left-1/2
        duplicated 2 times.

        translate-x-8
        duplicated 2 times.
```

### Step 4
The tool reports two unnecessary duplicates: `left-1/2` and `translate-x-8`.
Let's check the source code of the component:

```js /left-1/ /translate-x-8/
className="absolute transform sm:left-1/2 sm:top-0 sm:translate-x-8 lg:left-1/2 lg:top-1/2 lg:-translate-y-1/2 lg:translate-x-8"
```

We can remove `lg:left-1/2` and keep `sm:left-1/2` due to CSS inheritance,
making it redundant. The same applies to `sm:translate-x-8` and
`lg:translate-x-8`.

As you can see, it's easy to clean up unnecessary classes. Klassco can do this
automatically, but it's important to understand the process. These duplicates
can be hard to spot and impractical to remove manually in large projects.

While you might consider using a text editor to perform a global search and
replace, this won't always work. Klassco is smart enough to understand when a
class is truly redundant and when it's necessary due to changes at different
breakpoints/states.

For example, consider the following:

```js
className="sm:opacity-50 md:opacity-50 hover:opacity-50 xl:opacity-100"
```

In this case, Klassco will only remove `md:opacity-50`, understanding that `hover:opacity-50` is necessary once the xl breakpoint is in use.

In cases without any prefixes, such as `className="classA classB
classA"{:js}`, Klassco will remove the first occurrence of classA due to how
CSS works. `className="classB classA"{:js}`
</Steps>

## Automatic purge
Klassco can automatically delete all the unnecessary classnames from your
components. You can configure it to do this every time you save the file you
are working on or perform a global action to remove all duplicates from all files in your project.

Learn more about this in the [Options [&#8599;]](../options) section, and
check the [dev [&#8599;]](https://github.com/cipherlogs/klassco) branch of
repo for upcoming features/changes.

<Callout>
when using the option `-m 1`, Klassco will report how many duplicates were
found on **that line** itself instead of the whole file, for example
`sm:opacity-50 md:opacity-10 lg:opacity-50` it will show that `opacity-50` was
repeated twice in that line, however when using the tool to remove the useless
duplicates, it won't count them as duplicates so the previous line will be
ignored.

the reason is that when you are using Klassco in analysis mode it is helful to
see what duplicates you have in your code, but when you use the tool to minify
or remove duplicates, only the true duplicates will be removed.

learn how [**-m --min** [&#8599;]](/options/min) works.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">If you have `tailwind-prettier`, all duplicates will be
grouped together. However, for compatibility with vanilla CSS or other CSS
libraries, Klassco assumes you don't have it.</Callout>



## Your turn
Try scanning the whole `src` directory of one of your projects with Klassco:

```bash
$ klassco -m 1 src
```

**How many unnecessary duplicates of length 1 did you find?**



## Next steps
Now that we've learned how to remove unnecessary duplicates from our codebase,
it's time to deal with duplicates that can't be removed. In [Phase
2](/quick-start/phase2), we'll learn how to build layers and abstract.
