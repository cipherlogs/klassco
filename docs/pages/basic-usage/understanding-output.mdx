# Interpreting the Output
The output of Klassco can change depending on the flags used. This might be
confusing if you're not accustomed to composable flags.

In this brief guide, we'll explore a small example to give you a basic
understanding. However, for a comprehensive understanding, please refer to
[Composable Flags [&#8599;]](../core-concepts/key-features).


Consider the following code:

```html {1,2,5,6} filename="index.html"
<div className="classB classD classE classA classC">
  <p className="classE">Three</p>
</div>

<div className="classD classE classD">
  <p className="classE classD">Four</p>
</div>
```

Scanning `index.html` with Klassco will yield the following results:

```bash {5}
$ klassco index.html

+ index.html:
        classD, classE
        duplicated 3 times.
```

Here, `classD` and `classE` are duplicated 3 times within `index.html`.
However, in larger files or projects, you might be more interested in the
number of unique duplicates rather than the total number of duplications. For
this, you can use the summary flag `-s` or `--summary`.

```bash {4}
$ klassco index.html

+ index.html:
        found 1 duplicate.
```

Klassco now reports only one duplicate, as there's only one unique class
combination duplicated in the file. But don't mistake this for a single
duplication; the unique combination could be repeated numerous times.

The `--summary` flag is designed to help identify the number of unique
duplications, which can be useful in different scenarios.

Returning to our `index.html` example, `classD`, `classE` is duplicated three
times. Even if it were duplicated **1000 times**, it's a relatively simple fix
because it's just one class combination that needs to be abstracted and
replaced throughout the file.

However, if there are 1000 **unique** class combination duplications, it's a
different story. That's where `-s` comes in handy, helping you distinguish
between files that are easier to refactor and those that are more challenging.

In practice, you'll often use `-s` and `-t` against directories to quickly
assess which directory is more challenging to refactor.
