# File Path vs Directory Path
Consider the following file structure:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="A.jsx" />
    <FileTree.File name="B.jsx" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

The `src` folder houses two components, `A` and `B`.
Let's say we're about to create a new component `C`, without any prior
knowledge of the contents of `A` and `B`.

After 20 minutes, component `C` is ready.

<Callout type="warning">
Note that while developing `C`, there was no need to consider abstraction or
use Klassco. The development workflow remained **unchanged**.
</Callout>

Now, it's time to review and improve our code.

<Steps>
### Step 1
Start by analyzing `C.jsx` independently.

```bash
$ klassco C.jsx
```

We can begin by modifying `C` and removing duplicates. However, it may be
beneficial to hold off on these modifications until we perform the next step.
Klassco can provide us with an overview of other duplications that may be
occurring in nearby components.


### Step 2
After analyzing `C.jsx`, it's time to get a broader view of all components
within the `src` folder.

```bash
$ klassco src
```

This step helps identify duplications in nearby components and provides
insights into potential duplication patterns that may arise in the future.

Now, we're equipped to make meaningful changes to `C.jsx`.

### Step 3
The bonus step involves instructing Klassco to perform a comprehensive scan of
all files **in relation to each other**.

```bash
$ klassco -g src
```

By extracting only the repetitions that are present across `A`, `B`, and `C`,
we can address these duplications and create better abstractions for future
components.
</Steps>

## Keep in Mind
As you write more code, the process will be repeated multiple times. The
advantage of Klassco is that it aids in making informed decisions by providing
the ability to **zoom in** and **out** before finalizing a decision.

## Excluding Specific Files
<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="components" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="Hero.jsx" />
    <FileTree.File name="Team.jsx" />
    <FileTree.File name="Pricing.jsx" />
    <FileTree.File name="Contact.jsx" />
    <br />

    <FileTree.Folder name="foundation" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="Modal.jsx" />
      <FileTree.File name="Table.jsx" />
      <FileTree.File name="Form.jsx" />

      <br />
      <FileTree.Folder name="elementary" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="Button.jsx" />
        <FileTree.File name="Checkbox.jsx" />
        <FileTree.File name="Radio.jsx" />

        <br />
        <FileTree.Folder name="base" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.File name="Text.jsx" />
          <FileTree.File name="Image.jsx" />
          <FileTree.File name="Link.jsx" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>


The file structure above uses nested folders to represent a hierarchy flow,
with higher-level components at the top and lower-level components at the
bottom. Each abstracted layer can only access the layer underneath it, meaning
that `Hero`, `Team`, `Pricing`, and `Contact` were only built by the
components found in `foundation`, and they are not allowed to go two layers
deep. The same rule applies to the rest.

The aim is to create highly modular components, broken down into smaller
pieces for reuse by higher-level components. Therefore, every time you create
a new abstraction layer, you need to abstract it well, so that the future
layer that will come next will never need to go two layers deep.

Klassco encourages this file structure that supports layering, and by not
offering an option to exclude files or folders from the search, when this
structure is used, you are forced to make good design. If a directory path
includes files you wish to exclude from the scan, it’s an indication that they
should be relocated.

<Callout type="warning">
Please note that you can use any file structure you
want. However, once you start nesting folders, Klassco will switch to the
modular mode that’s explained above.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
The `dev` branch of Klassco includes a `--no-recursive` feature, allowing you to scan only the contents of a folder, excluding its subfolders.
