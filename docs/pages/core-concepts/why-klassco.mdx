# Write once, use everywhere
After you saw the ugly truth when we scanned `tailwindcss.com` you might
be curious now to know how klassco can help you and your team.

In this fast walkthrough, you will

You might think that using a front-end framework and working with components,
duplicates are a bit okay because at the end of the day you will encapsualte
your component and use it again and again. but as we saw when we scanned the
`tailwindcss.com` application using `klassco` it was a disaster. and to remind
you that was top notch code that was written by devs who made tailwind

Components can't help you when it comes to css, you will repeat the same
effort and time everytime you'll try to recreate something. Components are only there to help you abstract your jsx
and javascript however they can't abstract your css. you will repeat
the same work again and again. in every project you make.

Klassco will offer you the best way to also abstract your css(just like you do with
components) and what's more powerful, once you create these abstraction
you will use them for the rest of your life. you only make the effort
once and you can use it in every future project of yours.


+ Why Klassco matters, why is it crucial, how does it save time and effort.
+ how do duplicates grow so fast.
+ how about performance
+ next step, learn how to abstract
+ without abstraction nobody will advance, you will stay stuck at your place
+ show how those abstractions will get replaced easily by klassco

readible, and it makes complete sense, you can write stuff, and walk for months and when you come back you will understand exactly what that line means


# Why
Klassco recommends using low-level utility classes (i.e Tailwind) because they
offer the fastest workflow and help you avoid premature abstraction and the
associated pain.

The tool is designed to not interrupt this workflow and should be
used when your project reaches a mature state. At this point, it’s best to
take a step back and analyze how everything fits together before making
abstraction decisions that will work **for the entire project, rather than
just the current file you’re working on.**
