# Sorting in Klassco
By default, Klassco displays results in the order they were found, without any
sorting.

However, you can easily sort the output in ascending or descending order. This
guide will show you how, building on what you learned in [Composable Flags
[&#8599;]](../core-concepts/key-features).


<br />
## Examples
**Sort from lowest to highest duplication:**

```bash
$ klassco --asc
```

**Sort from highest to lowest duplication:**

```bash
$ klassco --desc
```

<br />

Sorting can be useful when narrowing down your search. For instance, to find
the file with the least amount of duplicated combo classes, use:

```bash
$ klassco -s --asc -d 1 src
```

To find the class combo that's least duplicated across all files in the `src`
folder, use:

```bash
$ klassco -s -g --asc -d 1 src
```

<br />
## conclusion
Klassco allows you to easily sort your final output. This feature is
particularly useful when working on large codebases and determining which
parts to prioritize for refactoring.
