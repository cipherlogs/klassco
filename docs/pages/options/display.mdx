# Managing Output Control
The current version of Klassco is verbose by default, providing all possible
results. While this can be helpful, it might be overwhelming, especially for
large projects.

Consider the following output:

```bash {3,10,12,22,25}
$ klassco src/

+ src/file1.js:
      absolute, inset-x-0
      duplicated 3 times.

      -z-10, absolute
      duplicated 2 times.

      ... and many more duplicates were found in file1.js

+ src/file2.js:
      blur-3xl, inset-x-0
      duplicated 2 times.

      fixed, z-50
      duplicated 2 times.

      flex, items-center
      duplicated 3 times.

  ... and many more results were found in file2.js


... still more files
```

In this example, running Klassco on `src` yields an extensive amount of
information. To streamline this, it's beneficial to specify what you're
looking for.


<br />
For instance, you might only want to see the first 2 results of each file
within `src`:


```bash
$ klassco -d 3 src

+ src/file1.js
      result1
      duplicated n times.

      result2
      duplicated n times.

+ src/file2.js
      result1
      duplicated n times.

      result2
      duplicated n times.

+ src/file3.js
      result1
      duplicated n times.

      result2
      duplicated n times.
```

<br />
Or perhaps you're interested in the highest combo class duplications found in
each file:


```bash
$ klassco --desc -d 1 src

+ src/file1.js
      hover:bg-slate-100, hover:text-slate-900
      duplicated 4 times.


+ src/file2.js
      flex, items-center
      duplicated 3 times.


+ src/file3.js
      flex, items-center
      duplicated 5 times.
...
```

<br />
Alternatively, you might want to identify the **top 3** files with the most
duplications:

```bash
$ klassco --desc -d 3 -s src

+ src/BuildAnything.js
      found 373 duplicates.

+ src/ComponentDriven.js
      found 184 duplicates.

+ src/MobileFirst.js
      found 114 duplicates.
```

<br />
The previous command sorts everything in descending order. If you'd prefer to
filter files with the least amount of duplication, you can use `--asc` or
provide a negative number to `-d` to select 3 results from the bottom:

```bash
$ klassco --desc -d -3 -s src

+ src/shadow.html
      found 1 duplicate.

+ src/SpacingScale.js
      found 1 duplicate.

+ src/Responsive.js
      found 1 duplicate.
```


<br />
## Conclusion
This guide provided examples on how to tailor Klassco's output to your
specific needs. You learned how to use positive and negative numbers with `-d`
or `--display` to select results from the top or bottom.

Klassco's verbosity by default is designed to make it as easy and quick as
possible to get the information you need.

The `dev` branch offers a less verbose version where you must explicitly use
the `--verbose` flag. However, this might require additional flags to specify
your needs. Ultimately, both versions offer similar functionality, and it's
often easier to pare down information than to add it.
