# Specifying File Extensions
By default, Klassco searches for the following file types: `js`, `jsx`, `ts`,
`tsx`, and `html`.

However, you may want to specify certain files or use a different front-end
framework. In that case, you can use the `-e` or `--extensions` flag to
specify which files to look for.

For example, to search for `.js` and `.vue` files, you can run the following
command:

```bash
$ klassco -e "js vue"
```
