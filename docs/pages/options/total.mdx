# Understanding `-t` and `--total`
The behavior of `-t` or `--total` is contingent on the other flags and options
it's composed with.

Instead of viewing `-t` as a flag that displays the total number of
duplications found, it's more accurate to perceive `-t` as an optionn that
sums up the final results displayed by Klassco's output.

For instance:

- `klassco -t src` outputs the total number of duplicates within `src`.

- `klassco -t -g src` outputs the total number of common duplicates within `src`.

- `klassco -t -s src` outputs the total number of unique duplicates within `src`.


These are just basic examples. The key takeaway is that Klassco provides
composable flags, which adapt and change based on how you compose them.


<Callout type="info">
In the current version of Klassco, using `-t` is more verbose as it also
displays other results, not just the total sum. If you prefer to only see the
total sum and use `--verbose` when needed, please check the `dev` branch to
start using these options.
