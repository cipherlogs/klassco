# Identifying Unique Duplications

Let's consider the following code:

```html {1,2,5,6} filename="index.html"
<div className="classB classD classE classA classC">
  <p className="classE">Three</p>
</div>

<div className="classD classE classD">
  <p className="classE classD">Four</p>
</div>
```
When we scan `index.html` with Klassco, we get the following results:


```bash {5}
$ klassco index.html

+ index.html:
        classD, classE
        duplicated 3 times.
```

The class combination `classD classE` appears 3 times within the file. The key
insight here is that `index.html` has only one unique class combination
duplication.


To identify the number of unique class combination duplications in each file,
we can use Klassco:


```bash {4}
$ klassco index.html

+ index.html:
        found 1 duplicate.
```

<br />

### Which has the most duplicates [#most-duplicates]
This information is useful for identifying which files contain the most
duplications and require significant work.

```bash
$ klassco -s --desc -d 1 src
```

In this command, we're searching for the file in the `src` folder that
requires the most refactoring.

By using `-s`, we instruct Klassco to report only the number of unique
duplicates in each file. We then sort the results in descending order and
display only the top result. So, if `src` contains 10000 components, we'll
easily identify the components that require the most refactoring.
