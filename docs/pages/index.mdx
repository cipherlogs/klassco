# 1. Let's Scan `tailwindcss.com`
As the creators of TailwindCSS, they could serve as a benchmark for other
developers using Tailwind. If we uncover inefficiencies here, it could
suggest even greater inefficiencies among less experienced Tailwind users.

Let's scan their source code using Klassco

<Steps>
### Get the source code of `tailwindcss.com`

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com
$ cd tailwindcss.com
```

### Scan the `src` folder

```bash {4}
$ klassco -m 7 -t src

---
67020 duplicates so far...
```
</Steps>

This scan only accounted for duplicates of length 7 `-m 7`, excluding duplicates of lengths 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.

The result? **Sixty seven thousand duplicates** and counting. Can you imagine
the total if we included those? Half a million? A million? <ins>Neither would
surprise me</ins>.

## 2. But, I don't use Tailwind
Tailwind was just an example, repetition is inevitable. This is true for all
methodologies, modular methodologies like BEM and atomic approaches like
Tailwind, where utility classes will lead to <ins>extensive redundancy</ins>.


## 3. Should I be worried?
One might assume that the deliberate repetition of classes in Tailwind is
without consequences, and that employing front-end components is the optimal
strategy to address this issue. This assumption is not accurate, and we will
explore real examples to substantiate this claim.

It's crucial to recognize that duplication, at its essence, signifies an opportunity for enhancement, irrespective of whether it pertains to Tailwind, Vanilla CSS, or any programming language. While components certainly contribute to improvement, there exists a potential **for even more refined solutions**.


Let's examine Klassco on some [real-world examples](#next).


## 4. How Does Klassco Work?
There are three available modes, each independent of the others. This means
that if you're only interested in reducing the bundle size, you can use
Klassco solely for that purpose.

1. **Dev**: It scans all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and other
   templates for classname combo duplications to help you reuse styles and
   create higher abstractions.

2. **Watch**: It automatically replaces classname combinations with new
   utilities as you type, using the ones you have created or loaded.

3. **Build**: It optimizes the build size by removing all duplicate combos.


Klassco uses mathematical combinations to thoroughly explore and analyze
**every imaginable combination** of your CSS classnames, to help you identify
subtle patterns, spot redundancies, remove duplicates, and create a carefully
curated selection of higher level utilities **â€” designed to save you time and
effort.**
