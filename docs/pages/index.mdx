# 1. Let's Scan `tailwindcss.com`
As the creators of TailwindCSS, they could serve as a benchmark for other
developers using Tailwind. If we uncover inefficiencies here, it could
suggest even greater inefficiencies among less experienced Tailwind users.

Let's scan their source code using Klassco

<Steps>
### Get the source code of `tailwindcss.com`

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com
$ cd tailwindcss.com
```

### Scan the `src` folder

```bash {4}
$ klassco -m 7 -t src

---
67020 duplicates so far...
```
</Steps>

This scan only accounted for duplicates of length 7 `-m 7`, excluding duplicates of lengths 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.

The result? **Sixty seven thousand duplicates** and counting. Can you imagine
the total if we included those? Half a million? A million? <ins>Neither would
surprise me</ins>.

## 2. But, I don't use Tailwind
Tailwind is only one example of how repetition is unavoidable. This applies to
all the conventions that have emerged, such as CSS in Javascript, SMACSS,
OOCSS, BEM, and atomic approaches like Tailwind.


## 3. Should I be worried? [#big-goal]
One might assume that the deliberate repetition of classes in Tailwind is
without consequences, and that employing front-end components is the optimal
strategy to address this issue. This assumption is not accurate, and we will
explore real examples to substantiate this claim.

It's crucial to recognize that duplication, at its essence, **signifies an
opportunity for enhancement**, irrespective of whether it pertains to
Tailwind, Vanilla CSS, or a programming language. While components certainly
contribute to improvement, there exists a potential **for even more refined
solutions**.

You may be familiar with [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) and similar projects that
let you create a UI by simply describing it as a prompt. Although the process
requires several iterations to achieve satisfactory results, the vision is
promising. However the output code is no different from what you would write
yourself.

Now, imagine a different scenario: what if writing code for UI was <ins>easier
than writing a prompt?</ins> What if you could build stunning interfaces with
minimal effort and maximum flexibility?

Follow our [Quick Start](/quick-start) series and by phase 5, you will be amazed by what you can do.


## 4. How Does Klassco Work?
There are three available modes, each independent of the others. This means
that if you're only interested in reducing the bundle size, you can use
Klassco solely for that purpose.

1. **Dev**: It scans all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and other
   templates for classname combo duplications to help you reuse styles and
   create higher abstractions.

2. **Watch**: It automatically replaces classname combinations with new
   utilities as you type, using the ones you have created or loaded.

3. **Build**: It optimizes the build size by removing all duplicate combos.


Klassco uses mathematical combinations to thoroughly explore and analyze
**every imaginable combination** of your CSS classnames, to help you identify
subtle patterns, spot redundancies, remove duplicates, and create a carefully
curated selection of higher level utilities **— designed to save you time and
effort.**
