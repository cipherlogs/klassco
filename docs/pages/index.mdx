# The 8-Month Time and Resource Drain


Would you like to know the <Red text="time and effort that was wasted" /> by the devs who
created `tailwindcss.com`.

As the creators of `Tailwind CSS`, they could serve as a benchmark for other
developers using Tailwind. If we uncover inefficiencies here, it could suggest
even greater inefficiencies among less experienced Tailwind users.

Let's scan their source code using Klassco

<Steps>
### Get the source code of `tailwindcss.com`

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com
$ cd tailwindcss.com
```

### Scan the `src` folder

```bash {4}
$ klassco -m 7 -t src

---
67020 duplicates so far...
```
</Steps>

**Sixty seven thousand duplicates** and counting. This scan only accounted for
duplicates of length 7 `-m 7`, excluding duplicates of lengths 2, 3, 4, and so
on.

Can you imagine the total if we included those? Half a million? A million?
**Neither would surprise me**.


## The Hidden Cost
Assuming it takes a minute to create a combination of 7 classes, our
preliminary scan reported 67000 duplicates. That equates to 46 days of wasted
time.

Consider this class combination:

```js
className="p-6 max-w-sm mx-auto bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md flex items-center space-x-4"
```

It takes time to decipher each class and understand their collective purpose.
Even then, the overall context remains unclear.

Modifying this combination requires understanding how each class interacts,
making the necessary changes, and then verifying the result. This process
repeats until the desired outcome is achieved.

If we had abstracted these classes into higher-level utilities, we could have
avoided this mental overhead. For example:

```js
className={`${modern("wrapper")} center-x`}
```

This immediately informs us that we have a modernized wrapper aligned along
the x-axis.

In this example, the `modern()` utility is smart enough to give a modern look
to wherever type was given to it (input, form, div, wrapper) and incorporate
rounded corners, shadows, hover effects, active states, and more, tailored to
the specific type.

The `center` utility efficiently manages centering, adapting seamlessly to
various contexts like flexbox, block, or grid layouts.

These example utilities abstract away cumbersome low-level details, sparing us
the need to delve into intricacies. When I wish to center something, I simply
use the 'center' util â€“ no need to consider the display type, whether
it's flexbox, the direction (column or row), or whether to use justify-content
or align items.

So realistacally the time it takes to create a 7-class combination can range
from 1 to 15 minutes, and that's assuming no bugs. Revisiting the component
later requires the same mental overhead to recall the purpose of each class.

If we conservatively estimate just 5 minutes per combination, the time wasted
on our preliminary scan alone equates to nearly 8 months. **What's worse, this
time and effort will be wasted again in your next project, and the next, and
the next.**

And remember, this only accounts for duplicates of length 7. The total waste
across all lengths is staggering.


![Adam tweet about @apply](../public/adam-tweet.png)
I concur with Adam. However, Tailwind's low-level utilities lack the ability
to build higher-level abstractions. This is where Klassco steps in, addressing
the shortcomings of Tailwind's `@apply`


<br />
## How it works?
It scans all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and other
templates for class names to help you reuse styles and remove any duplicates.

Klassco uses mathematical combinations to thoroughly explore and analyze
**every imaginable combination** of your CSS classes, to help you identify
subtle patterns, spot redundancies, and create a carefully curated selection
of unique class combinations.

It solves the problem that front-end framework components cannot solve when it
comes to CSS.

**Klassco is designed to save you time and effor.**


## But, I don't use Tailwind
Tailwind was just an example, repetition is inevitable . As projects scale,
managing this repetition becomes increasingly challenging.

This is true for all methodologies, modular methodologies like BEM and atomic
approaches like Tailwind, where utility classes will lead to **extensive
redundancy**.

## Next Steps
The next step is to understand why every team and developer should integrate
Klassco. By examining the amount of time and effort it saves, you can see the
benefits of using this tool.
